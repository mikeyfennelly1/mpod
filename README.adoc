== Notice about pause in development

mpod is intended to be a container engine that will eventually run on top of mrun. mrun is currently under devleopment, and is close to a second, more comprehensive version, which will account for Linux security modules, advanced cgroup features, and a generally more modular - chained initialization architecture.

Check out link:https://github.com/mikeyfennelly1/mrun/tree/init-chain[mrun] for the current state of mrun.

More coming soon...
